# aftercall

Cloudflare Worker that ingests Bluedot meeting transcripts → OpenAI extraction + embeddings → Cloudflare D1 + Vectorize → Notion (transcript pages + Followups task DB). Exposes an MCP server at `/mcp` with GitHub OAuth so the indexed calls are queryable from Claude.ai.

## Architecture

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Webhook + processing | Cloudflare Workers |
| Transcript store | Cloudflare D1 (SQLite, Drizzle schema) |
| Embeddings | Cloudflare Vectorize (1536d, cosine) |
| LLM | OpenAI `gpt-5-mini` (structured outputs) + `text-embedding-3-small` |
| Output | Notion API (direct fetch — NOT `@notionhq/client`, broken in workerd) |
| MCP server | `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` Streamable HTTP (stateless mode) |
| MCP auth | `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` + GitHub OAuth, KV-backed |
| Observability | `@sentry/cloudflare` (optional — no-op when `SENTRY_DSN` unset) |

Single user (GitHub username allowlist via `ALLOWED_USERS` env). Friends fork to host their own.

## Conventions

- **TDD strict** — failing test first, minimal impl, refactor
- **Conventional Commits** — `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, etc.
- **Feature branches, not straight-to-main** — every new feature, fix, or non-trivial chore goes on a branch named `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `chore/...`, or `docs/...`. PR → self-review → squash-merge to `main`. Only the rarest exception (typo fix, one-line docs) merits a direct push. Previous commits on main are grandfathered; new work follows this rule.
- **Conductor** — project context lives in `conductor/` (product.md, tech-stack.md, workflow.md, tracks.md). New multi-phase features create a track spec before implementation. Setup state (`setup_state.json`) is gitignored; decision artifacts are committed.
- **Idempotency** is non-negotiable — D1 has `UNIQUE(video_id)`, Vectorize uses deterministic IDs (`{transcript_id}-{chunk_index}`)
- **D1 write FIRST** in the handler — gates Notion writes so concurrent retries dedupe before any side effects
- **Notion failures are non-fatal** — D1 is source of truth; Notion is a derived view
- **Pipeline failures return 500** so Svix retries
- **MCP transport is stateless** — one transport per request, `enableJsonResponse: true`, no `Mcp-Session-Id`. No cross-request state; simpler to reason about.
- **MCP tools are pure functions** colocated under `src/mcp/tools/` — each accepts `(args, env, deps?)` and returns a `{ content: [{ type: "text", text }] }` shape. Tests call these directly (no SDK) for fast, isolated unit tests.
- **`src/mcp/handler.ts` dynamic-imports `./tools`** so loading the OAuth-wrapped worker in non-MCP tests doesn't pull the SDK + ajv into scope (vitest-pool-workers can't resolve ajv's internal JSON import in its ESM shim). If you add new MCP wiring, keep the dynamic-import boundary.
- **Sentry is optional** — `src/index.ts` calls `Sentry.withSentry` with `enabled: Boolean(env.SENTRY_DSN)` so forkers without a DSN get a no-op. `scripts/deploy.mjs` checks for `.sentryclirc` / `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` before invoking `sentry-cli`; otherwise it just runs `wrangler deploy`. Don't couple new code to Sentry being present — always guard with `enabled`/env checks.
- **Pipeline tracing lives in `handler.ts`** — `Sentry.startSpan` wraps each stage (`openai.extract`, `openai.embed`, `d1.upsert_*`, `vectorize.upsert`, `notion.*`) plus a top-level `bluedot.pipeline.*` span. Every pipeline catch site calls `Sentry.captureException` with `video_id` + `svix_id` tags before returning 500. When adding new pipeline steps, wrap them in `startSpan` and mirror the capture pattern.
- **Extraction takes `meetingDate`** — `extractFromSummary()` expects the meeting's date so the model can resolve "Friday" / "Monday" into ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` for Notion's `Due` field. Without it, all `due_date`s fall back to natural-language phrases (which still render in the title but don't populate the Date property). Always pass `normalized.createdAt` from new call sites. Ambiguous phrases ("next week", "soon") are preserved verbatim by design.
- **Library docs via Context7 MCP** — prefer Context7 over web search / training-data recall when touching any library here. This repo is also indexed as `/jchu96/aftercall` — query it for examples of the patterns below. Optional for forkers — install at [context7.com](https://context7.com) if you want it.

## Common Tasks

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Run tests | `npx vitest run` |
| Typecheck | `npx tsc --noEmit` |
| Local dev (Vectorize remote) | `npx wrangler dev` |
| Deploy | `npm run deploy` (wrapper that uploads source maps to Sentry when configured) |
| Deploy (raw) | `npx wrangler deploy` |
| Tail logs | `npx wrangler tail` |
| Generate D1 migration | `npx drizzle-kit generate --name <description>` |
| Apply D1 migration | `npx wrangler d1 migrations apply aftercall-db --remote` |
| Set a secret | `npx wrangler secret put <NAME>` |
| Reprocess a call | `npx wrangler d1 execute aftercall-db --remote --command "DELETE FROM transcripts WHERE video_id = '...'"` then refire |
| Rotate MCP bearer (yours) | `POST /auth/revoke` with the current bearer → revokes grant |
| List KV entries (debug OAuth) | `npx wrangler kv key list --binding OAUTH_KV` |
| Inspect a KV entry | `npx wrangler kv key get <key> --binding OAUTH_KV` |

## Don't

- ❌ Import `@notionhq/client` — fails in workerd (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')`). Use direct `fetch`.
- ❌ Add a Notion `Title` property — Notion's default title property is named `Name`. Use `Name`.
- ❌ Test against mocked D1 — use `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` so tests hit real SQLite via miniflare. Vectorize must still be mocked (no miniflare support yet).
- ❌ Forget `--remote` on `wrangler d1 migrations apply` for the prod database.
- ❌ Re-introduce Anthropic — single LLM provider (OpenAI) is intentional, simplifies deploy + setup story for forkers.
- ❌ Skip the `global_fetch_strictly_public` compat flag — `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` warns at module load and vitest-pool-workers fails without it.
- ❌ Import `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` at the top of any non-MCP module path — its transitive `ajv` dep breaks vitest-pool-workers' ESM shim. Keep SDK imports behind the dynamic-import boundary in `src/mcp/handler.ts`.
- ❌ Add stateful MCP sessions without a plan — the Streamable HTTP transport's stateful mode carries server memory across requests, which doesn't compose with CF Workers' isolate-per-request model unless you persist session state in KV/DO yourself.
- ❌ Hard-require Sentry — keep the `enabled: Boolean(env.SENTRY_DSN)` guard in `src/index.ts` and the `.sentryclirc` / `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` check in `scripts/deploy.mjs`. Forkers must be able to clone + deploy without a Sentry account.

## Repo Layout

See [README.md](./README.md) for full structure. Quick map:

```
src/             # Worker code (handler, extract, d1, vectorize, notion, ...)
scripts/         # setup.ts (interactive provisioning), smoke-vectorize.ts
drizzle/         # Numbered SQL migrations
test/            # vitest setup (D1 migrations + ProvidedEnv typing)
```

## Plan-reviewer discipline

When making non-trivial changes, run a plan-reviewer pass before implementing. Track major architectural decisions in commit messages.
